This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: an infinite loop caused by a missing dependency in the dependency array. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises when a state variable used within the `useEffect` is not included in the dependency array. This causes the effect to re-run on every render, leading to an infinite loop. The solution involves adding the relevant state variables to the dependency array, ensuring that the effect only runs when those variables change.
